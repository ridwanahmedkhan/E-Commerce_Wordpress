E-Commerce_Wordpress
====================
This is a website I developed using wordpress.For E-commerce functionality I used <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> plugin.
As a wordpress theme I used a free theme from <a href="http://www.woothemes.com" target="_blank">WooThemes</a> named <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/wootique/" target="_blank">Wootique</a> 

To have a look at the project :
You have to install Lamp/Apache with MySql in your computer.
Then download the project.
Create a database specified in the wp-config.php file and change the username and password according to your DB username and password.
then using localhost install the web application and Enjoy !

Thanks all!
